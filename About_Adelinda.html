				<p>
				Raelyn is just your average teenage girl, except she can do things most teenagers can&#8217t. 
				With no memory before she arrived at the orphanage when she was seven, she has no clue who or what she is. 
				However, after coming in contact with some mysterious newcomers, all her memories come flooding back. 
				She&#8217s actually from a whole other dimension. She was sent to Earth right before her parents were killed by people hunting her brother. 
				Now she must return to the other dimension to save a village her innocent brother allegedly attacked several years ago. 
				Now, she must learn to fit in with the new society and save a people that don&#8217t want to be saved.

				<h2><u>Reading Between the lines</u></h2>
				<p>
				I must apologize to all my high school teachers and college professors, 
				because I'll admit that I wrote a majority of this during my classes instead of paying attention.
				However, that's not entirely true. In a way, I've written this story many times. 
				I've had an interest in dragons ever since I was really little, 
				and I'm a sucker for romance and dark, mysterious guys.
				This story has been a long time in the making, and has been influenced by everything in my life.
				When you read this book, I feel like you get to know me and what my interests are.
				If you want to know more about how this book came to be, head over to the influences tab to see
				the pictures and hear the music that inspired the characters and events of this book.
